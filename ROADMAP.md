# Roadmap

This is the roadmap for `extpark`.

- Add a new streak of icons for the toolbar in the top right
- Create a logo
- Support sub-panels
- Support buttons for panels
- Provide the panel with the ExtensionPanel object to allow handler registration
- Create an action to export the extension
- Remove unused CSS classes
- Use some CodeMirror addons
